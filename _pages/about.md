I'm an applied research scientist with experience with Python and R programming.  I enjoy working on difficult technical problems and understanding how and why things work!  

My background is in applied earth science, but I've always worked with data and am happy trying to figure out solutions to problems that aren't terribly obvious!

Outside of work I like cycling, board sports (surfing, snowboarding), training cats, and playing traditional music.  I'm also an instrument maker and like making things that make pleasant noises!
