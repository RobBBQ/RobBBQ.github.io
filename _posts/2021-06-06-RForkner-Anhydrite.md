# Overview
### In many subsurface petroleum reservoirs, mobile minerals like anhydrite can occlude pore space.  This can be a major problem, especially when preducted reservoir space is clogged with something other than oil!
#### In this image, anhydrite (the white crystals) occludes almost all of the space!!

## Project Goals
### Use the available subsurface data (petrophysical data and core descriptions) to:
#### 1. Establish a predictive model to account for anhydrite distribution in the subsurface.
#### 2. Export that model to adjacent cores, and create regional maps of anhydrite distribution in the subsurface.

### Step 1. Install Modules and Libraries:
