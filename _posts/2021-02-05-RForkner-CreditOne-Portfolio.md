# Overview
### Over the past year or so Credit One has seen an increase in the number of customers who are defaulting on their payments.  They need a much better way to understand how much credit to allow someone to use or, at the very least, if someone should be approved or not.

## Project Goals
### Use the demographic data to determine:
#### 1. How much credit should customers be allowed
#### 2. Should a potential customer be approved for credit?

### Step 1. Install Modules and Libraries:


```python
#Import SQL querying modules and Pandas into your notebook
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
import pymysql
import pandas as pd
#DS Basics
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import scipy
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import math
from math import sqrt
import seaborn as sns
#Pandas Profiling
import pandas_profiling
#SKLearn Stuff
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.svm import SVR
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix
from sklearn import linear_model
#model metrics
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
from sklearn import tree
from sklearn import metrics
```

### Step 2. Download dataset with MySQL and save:


```python
#create a connection to MySQL database
db_connection_str = 'mysql+pymysql://deepanalytics:Sqltask1234!@34.73.222.197/deepanalytics'
db_connection = create_engine(db_connection_str)
#use the following SELECT statement and query the Credit One data to extract it into a Pandas dataframe
df = pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM credit', con=db_connection)
#save data to CSV
df.to_csv('credit_one.csv',index=False)
```

#### Now that we have the data importing done, we can see that the data include the following information:
* LIMIT_BAL: Amount of the given credit (NT dollar): it includes both the individual consumer credit and his/her family (supplementary) credit.
* SEX: male / female
* EDUCATION: graduate school; university; high school; others).
* MARRIAGE: Marital status (1 = married; 2 = single; 3 = divorced; 0=others).
* AGE: Age in years
* PAY_: History of past payment. We tracked the past monthly payment records (from April to September) as follows: PAY_0 = the repayment status in September; PAY_1 = the repayment status in August; . . .; PAY_6 = the repayment status in April. *The measurement scale for the repayment status is: -2: No consumption; -1: Paid in full; 0: The use of revolving credit; 1 = payment delay for one month; 2 = payment delay for two months; . . .; 8 = payment delay for eight months; 9 = payment delay for nine months and above.*
* BILL_AMT: Amount of bill statement (NT dollar). BILL_AMT1 = amount of bill statement in September; BILL_AMT2 = amount of bill statement in August; . . .; BILL_AMT6 = amount of bill statement in April.
* PAY_AMT: Amount of previous payment (NT dollar). PAY_AMT1 = amount paid in September; PAY_AMT2 = amount paid in August; . . .; PAY_AMT6 = amount paid in April.
* Default Payment Next Month: If the customer defaulted in October

### Step 3. Now that the data are accounted for we need to tackle a few issues:
#### 1. Not all data are numeric, and even some numerical columns read as objects.  This is a problem because the analyses we'll want to perform require teh data to be numbers!
#### 2. Repeated rows
#### 3. Repeated headers

### Here's how we'll address these issues:
#### 1. Discretize variables as required- this means either encoding a data object as a number, or creating 'dummy' columns to indicate whether an object either represents or does not represent a category using either 0 or 1.
#### 2. Delete repeated rows
#### 3. Delete extra headers

### The first thing we'll do is export and re-open a new dataframe so that our changes to column headers are recognized and the associated data rows are understood as numeric:

```python
#export cleaned df called 'credit' to CSV called 'Credit_Clean'
credit.to_csv (r'C:\Users\rob\Data Analytics Course\Project 2\Credit_Clean.csv', index = False, header=True)
#import clean csv
data = pd.read_csv('Credit_Clean.csv')
Credit_Clean=data
```

### Now we'll encode the remaining data listed as objects so thet they'll be recognized as numeric values:


```python
#Label Encode Sex
le=LabelEncoder()
le.fit(Credit_Clean['SEX'])
Credit_Clean['SEX']=le.transform(Credit_Clean['SEX'])

#Label Encode Default
le=LabelEncoder()
le.fit(Credit_Clean['default payment next month'])
Credit_Clean['default payment next month']=le.transform(Credit_Clean['default payment next month'])

#Label Encode Default
le=LabelEncoder()
le.fit(Credit_Clean['EDUCATION'])
Credit_Clean['EDUCATION']=le.transform(Credit_Clean['EDUCATION'])

#convert non-numeric columns to a series of binary numeric 'Dummy' columns if encoding will produce more than 2 values
Credit_Clean = pd.get_dummies(Credit_Clean)
Credit_Clean.dtypes
```

    ID                            int64
    LIMIT_BAL                     int64
    SEX                           int32
    EDUCATION                     int32
    MARRIAGE                      int64
    AGE                           int64
    PAY_0                         int64
    PAY_2                         int64
    PAY_3                         int64
    PAY_4                         int64
    PAY_5                         int64
    PAY_6                         int64
    BILL_AMT1                     int64
    BILL_AMT2                     int64
    BILL_AMT3                     int64
    BILL_AMT4                     int64
    BILL_AMT5                     int64
    BILL_AMT6                     int64
    PAY_AMT1                      int64
    PAY_AMT2                      int64
    PAY_AMT3                      int64
    PAY_AMT4                      int64
    PAY_AMT5                      int64
    PAY_AMT6                      int64
    default payment next month    int32
    dtype: object



### GREAT!  Now that the data are all numeric, we'll explore the data a little bit.  Since we're wondering how much credit to give customers, we'll look at how the data might relate to customer's credit limit (LIMIT_BAL):


```python
#Data Visualization, Plot Histogram with bins
plt.hist(Credit_Clean['LIMIT_BAL'], bins=10)
plt.show()
```

![](/images/Project1images/RForkner_Credit_One_Portfolio_34_0.png)


### In order to set up the analysis, we'll re-arrange the variables in the dataset so that the variable we're modeling for, the credit limit (LIMIT_BAL) is last in the dataframe.  We'll then designate which data are used to the model the resulting credit limit.


```python
#re-order columns to put desired dependent variable last
column_names = ["ID", "SEX", "MARRIAGE", "AGE","EDUCATION","default payment next month","PAY_0","PAY_2","PAY_3","PAY_4","PAY_5","PAY_6","BILL_AMT1","BILL_AMT2","BILL_AMT3","BILL_AMT4","BILL_AMT5","BILL_AMT6","PAY_AMT1","PAY_AMT2","PAY_AMT3","PAY_AMT4","PAY_AMT5","PAY_AMT6", "LIMIT_BAL"]
Credit_Clean = Credit_Clean.reindex(columns=column_names)

# Setting the independent variables
X = Credit_Clean.iloc[:,1:23]
print('Summary of feature sample')
X.head()

#Setting Dependent Variable
y = Credit_Clean['LIMIT_BAL']
y.head()
    0     20000
    1    120000
    2     90000
    3     50000
    4     50000
    Name: LIMIT_BAL, dtype: int64
```

### In order to determine whether we can define any relationship between our data and a customer's credit limit (LIMIT_BAL) we'll start by trying 3 different models:
#### 1. Random Forest Regression - A method composed of multiple interations of random sampling through a dataset to arrive at the outcome.  This model then collects all the results at the end of the anaysis to compare to ground truth.
#### 2. Linear Regression - Attempting to model the relationship between modeled and ground truth results by fitting a linear equation to the data.
#### 3. Support Vector Regression - Similar to a linear regression except allowing for a wider boundary of error around the regression line.

##### In this case, since we're building 3 models and want assess them all at the same time, we'll create an empty list to store the results and another to hold the name of each algorithm so we can easily print out the results and keep them separated:

```python
#Prepare regression algorithms
algosClass = []
algosClass.append(('Random Forest Regressor',RandomForestRegressor()))
algosClass.append(('Linear Regression',LinearRegression()))
algosClass.append(('Support Vector Regression',SVR()))
#regression
results = []
names = []
for name, model in algosClass:
    result = cross_val_score(model, X,y, cv=3, scoring='r2')
    names.append(name)
    results.append(result)
```

### Now we'll split the dataset into a group for the algorithm to learn relationships on (training set) and a group for the algorithm to test it's results on (testing set):

```python
#Train/Test Split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = .25, random_state = 123)
```

### Here's the Random Forest Regression:


```python
#Regression Modeling
algo = RandomForestRegressor()
model = algo.fit(X_train,y_train)
#Make Predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
predRsquared = r2_score(y_test,predictions)
rmse = sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions))
print('R Squared: %.3f' % predRsquared)
print('RMSE: %.3f' % rmse)
```
### Random Forest Regression R Squared: 0.465
### Random Forest Regression Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): $94050.67

```python
#plotting results
plt.scatter(y_test, predictions, color=['blue'], alpha = 0.5)
plt.xlabel('Ground Truth')
plt.ylabel('Predictions')
plt.show();
```

![](/images/Project1images/RForkner_Credit_One_Portfolio_57_0.png)


### Here's the Linear Regression

```python
#Regression Modeling
algo = LinearRegression()
model = algo.fit(X_train,y_train)
#Make Predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
predRsquared = r2_score(y_test,predictions)
rmse = sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions))
print('R Squared: %.3f' % predRsquared)
print('RMSE: %.3f' % rmse)
```

### Linear Regression R Squared: 0.336
### Linear Regression Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): $104731.68



```python
#plotting results
plt.scatter(y_test, predictions, color=['green'], alpha = 0.5)
plt.xlabel('Ground Truth')
plt.ylabel('Predictions')
plt.show();
```


![](/images/Project1images/RForkner_Credit_One_Portfolio_66_0.png)

### Support Vector Regression
#### Similar to a linear regression except allowing for a wider boundary of error around the regression line.


```python
#Regression Modeling
algo = SVR()
model = algo.fit(X_train,y_train)
```


```python
#Predictions
preds = model.predict(X_test)
```


```python
#R squared value
print(r2_score(y_test, preds))
```

    -0.03583003584384947



```python
#RMSE root mean square error can't be calculated in one go, so we calculate mse then take the square root
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, preds)
```


```python
rmse = math.sqrt(mse)
```


```python
print((rmse))
```

    130824.5884282775



```python
#Make Predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
predRsquared = r2_score(y_test,predictions)
rmse = sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions))
print('R Squared: %.3f' % predRsquared)
print('RMSE: %.3f' % rmse)
```

    R Squared: -0.036
    RMSE: 130824.588



```python
#plotting results
plt.scatter(y_test, predictions, color=['red'], alpha = 0.5)
plt.xlabel('Ground Truth')
plt.ylabel('Predictions')
plt.show();
```

```python
for i in range(len(names)):
    print(names[i],results[i].mean())
```

    Random Forest Regressor 0.45994203673169737
    Linear Regression 0.3262248324035236
    Support Vector Regression -0.050522201381185905


### All three regression analyses returned very poor results with regards to accuracy!  Perhaps we should try classification analyses instead!

```python
#Basic Correlation Matrix
#corrMat = Credit_Clean.corr()
#print(corrMat)
```

![](images/Project1images/RForkner_Credit_One_Portfolio_Corr.png)

#### Looking at a quick heatmap of correlation between variables it's apparent that there isn't a direct relationship between the credit limit granted customers (LIMIT_BAL) and any other variable.  However, it is apparent that whether or not a customer will default does correlate with their payment history.


### Since we're gonig to try classification analyses the dependent variable (credit limit) needs to be discretized or binned.  We'll look at the distribution of the credit limit data to help guide the binning:



```python
#Data Visualization, Plot Histograms
sns.distplot(Credit_Clean['LIMIT_BAL'])
```

    C:\Users\rob\anaconda3\envs\Data_Analytics\lib\site-packages\seaborn\distributions.py:2551: FutureWarning: `distplot` is a deprecated function and will be removed in a future version. Please adapt your code to use either `displot` (a figure-level function with similar flexibility) or `histplot` (an axes-level function for histograms).
      warnings.warn(msg, FutureWarning)





    <AxesSubplot:xlabel='LIMIT_BAL', ylabel='Density'>




![png](RForkner_Credit_One_Portfolio_files/RForkner_Credit_One_Portfolio_78_2.png)



```python
#distribution of data
Credit_Clean['LIMIT_BAL'].describe(percentiles=[0, 1/3, 2/3, 1])
```




    count      30000.000000
    mean      167484.322667
    std       129747.661567
    min        10000.000000
    0%         10000.000000
    33.3%      80000.000000
    50%       140000.000000
    66.7%     200000.000000
    100%     1000000.000000
    max      1000000.000000
    Name: LIMIT_BAL, dtype: float64



### Since 2/3 of the customers have credit limits under 200K, but the maximum credit limit allowed is 1million, we will split the data into no more than 5 bins.


```python
#discretization using pandas cut.
Credit_Clean['LIMIT_BAL']  = pd.cut(Credit_Clean['LIMIT_BAL'], bins=4, labels=False)
Credit_Clean['LIMIT_BAL'].value_counts()
```




    0    23283
    1     6511
    2      200
    3        6
    Name: LIMIT_BAL, dtype: int64



#### Now re-run the analysis with random forest classifier.


```python
#re-order columns to put desired dependent variable last
column_names = ["ID", "SEX", "MARRIAGE", "AGE","EDUCATION","default payment next month","LIMIT_BAL","PAY_0","PAY_2","PAY_3","PAY_4","PAY_5","PAY_6","BILL_AMT1","BILL_AMT2","BILL_AMT3","BILL_AMT4","BILL_AMT5","BILL_AMT6","PAY_AMT1","PAY_AMT2","PAY_AMT3","PAY_AMT4","PAY_AMT5","PAY_AMT6"]
Credit_Clean = Credit_Clean.reindex(columns=column_names)
#print(Credit_Clean)
```


```python
#features, setting independent variables; removed ID as it was skewing the dataset
X = Credit_Clean.iloc[:,1:6]
print('Summary of feature sample')
X.head()
```

### In this case using binning and classification modeling we've been able to arrive at a better model for predicting credit limit among customers.  The model is about 78% accurate and weighs Age and Education as the most important variables in determining credit limit.


```python
feature_names=X.columns
print(feature_names)
```

    Index(['SEX', 'MARRIAGE', 'AGE', 'EDUCATION', 'default payment next month'], dtype='object')



```python
#importance of variables
feature_imp = pd.Series(algo.feature_importances_,index=feature_names).sort_values(ascending=False)
feature_imp
```




    AGE                           0.625595
    EDUCATION                     0.235429
    default payment next month    0.057261
    MARRIAGE                      0.056731
    SEX                           0.024984
    dtype: float64



### What about whether someone should be granted credit at all?  In this case we need to change the dependent variable we're modeling for from credit limit (LIMIT_BAL) to default.  Default is already a classified answer, either someone defaults or not, so the model will be based on classification methods rather than a regression.

####  First some additional tidying.  We'll remove past payment data that do not affect credit score, just to slim down the model.  The values -2 = No consumption; -1 = Paid in full, so we will remove them:


```python
#Remove Past payment data that do not affect credit score.
Credit_Clean['PAY_0'] = Credit_Clean['PAY_0'].replace(-2,0)
Credit_Clean['PAY_2'] = Credit_Clean['PAY_2'].replace(-2,0)
Credit_Clean['PAY_3'] = Credit_Clean['PAY_3'].replace(-2,0)
Credit_Clean['PAY_4'] = Credit_Clean['PAY_4'].replace(-2,0)
Credit_Clean['PAY_5'] = Credit_Clean['PAY_5'].replace(-2,0)
Credit_Clean['PAY_6'] = Credit_Clean['PAY_6'].replace(-2,0)

# do the same for the -1 variable
Credit_Clean['PAY_0'] = Credit_Clean['PAY_0'].replace(-1,0)
Credit_Clean['PAY_2'] = Credit_Clean['PAY_2'].replace(-1,0)
Credit_Clean['PAY_3'] = Credit_Clean['PAY_3'].replace(-1,0)
Credit_Clean['PAY_4'] = Credit_Clean['PAY_4'].replace(-1,0)
Credit_Clean['PAY_5'] = Credit_Clean['PAY_5'].replace(-1,0)
Credit_Clean['PAY_6'] = Credit_Clean['PAY_6'].replace(-1,0)
```

### Now we'll re-order the dataframe and set the variables.


```python
#re-order columns to put desired dependent variable last
column_names = ["ID", "SEX", "MARRIAGE", "AGE","PAY_0","PAY_2","PAY_3","PAY_4","PAY_5","PAY_6","BILL_AMT1","BILL_AMT2","BILL_AMT3","BILL_AMT4","BILL_AMT5","BILL_AMT6","PAY_AMT1","PAY_AMT2","PAY_AMT3","PAY_AMT4","PAY_AMT5","PAY_AMT6","EDUCATION","LIMIT_BAL","default payment next month"]
Credit_Clean = Credit_Clean.reindex(columns=column_names)
#print(Credit_Clean)
```


```python
#features, setting independent variables; removed ID as it was skewing the dataset
X = Credit_Clean.iloc[:,1:24]
print('Summary of feature sample')
X.head()
```

### So we end with a result of about 81% accuracy in answering the question whether or not we can come up with a model that can predict whether a customer should be given credit at all, and using our one example model we see that arriving at that answer used quite a few of the variables, including payment and billing history.
